# Linux Joystick with Arduino

## Project Description

In this project I'm creating a joystick with arduino that will work like a real joystick for linux!

## My setup

I am using:

- Ubuntu 22.04 (ARM edition)
- Arduino Uno (Original)
- Elegoo Joystick Module

## File structure

The repository structure is the following:

- `arduino/` contains the source for the arduino
- `driver/` contains the source for the driver
- `test/` contains the source to test if the joystick is working 

Every directory contains a README about that specific part
